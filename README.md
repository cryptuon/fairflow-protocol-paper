# FairFlow Protocol: Equitable Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) mitigation in Ethereum

Ethereum has become a popular platform for decentralized applications (dApps) due to its powerful smart contract capabilities. Nevertheless, Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) has been a major issue in the Ethereum ecosystem, with considerable implications for the platform's functioning and integrity. This paper introduces the FairFlow protocol, a new system created to address the MEV problem within Ethereum's existing infrastructure. The protocol seeks to create a fairer environment, preventing miners or validators from taking advantage of the system, and safeguarding user data. The combination of auction-based block space allocation and randomized transaction ordering significantly reduces the possibility of MEV exploitation.
